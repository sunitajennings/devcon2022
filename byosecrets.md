# After this session

You can continue to experiment with this & other sample apps using the MX Platform API  - you just need to sign up for your own developer account!


1. Sign up for a developer account at https://dashboard.mx.com. You'll need to provide a few pieces of information and a unique email address. Once you've done that you should get a welcome email in a few minutes.

2. Log into the [Client Dashboard](https://dashboard.mx.com) to obtain your Client ID and API Key.

3. Update the `.env` file with these values.

4. Run your app!


If you're looking to work with the MXconnect widget or the MX Platform API more, you can find a quickstart app and some helpful guides at https://docs.mx.com.
